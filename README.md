# Restaurant

Early pseudo is included in UML/proposal
  NOTE THAT THE PurchaseManager is still work in progress, and I plan to develop it more when I go further into this project.

  - I've noticed my UML for Account does not feature a setBalance method, but it is supposed to, so I am writing that here.

  - Additionally, I think It will be easier to take Customer.java from the bank program, rather than having all of it as a part of User. So, despite not being part of the UML, this will be another key piece.
